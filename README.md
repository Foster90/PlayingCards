# PlayingCards

Sencon Programming Exercises

Exercise 11:
Create a set of classes in a class library that can be used to represent a deck of playing cards. Also create a windows application that uses the classes to shuffle and 
deal the cards. The cards do not need to be represented by graphics just the value and suit will do. If you want to expand it to display graphics then feel free.

Cards show in a list that can be shufffle, and new deck can be re-dealt, an image of the card will apper next to the selected card.
